I wrote this code myself with help of the sources in the references section.
The program doesn't meet some of the specifications of this project.

* piping after a << hereis command doesn't work, the program returns a Invalid NULL. I believe this is because the pipearray is math is different to calculate where the pipe is located.
* If the command echo hi> | puts the invalid null command error message into a file name |. I believe this is happening because the redirection is done before the error message is executed and the echo hi doesnt execute. 
* On occasion when the multuple piping was happening, it wouldn't wait and the the command wouldnt fully execute. I called wait twice in order to make it wait but it works most times and sometimes it wont.
* On hereis command without a pipe it works when i test it on with ~cs570/Data4/input53 and get the correct output, but the autograder has a completly different output so i dont get the points.


Invidual choices:
* I used CHK to exit upon failure and produce error messages for me in some cases instead of writing the error message code and exit codes because it was faster.
